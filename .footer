<h2>Thanks!</h2>

<p>I'm very much obliged to Johannes Winkelmann, the
author of prt-get, for supporting the alternative format I chose.</p>

<p>Also many many thanks to Leander van Hoesel, for encouraging me
to make a public version of c4o and for making the logo. He also
has his own c4o repository! Which is offline ATM.</p>
