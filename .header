<h1>
  Cruxports for OpenBSD
</h1>

<h2>
  About
</h2>

<p>
  In 2000 Per Liden started <a href="http://crux.nu"
  traget="_blank">CRUX-Linux</a>, a distro based on
  simplicity. The idea for the ports system was influenced by BSD
  ports, but written in sh and C++, the Pkgfiles which define how
  a package should be build are nothing but simple shell-scripts.
</p>

<p>
  Cruxports for OpenBSD is a port/rewrite of the CRUX ports-system
   to OpenBSD, and is completely written in sh, except for a
   simple parser written in C.
</p>

<p>
  Now I hear you say: "What's wrong with the normal ports?"
  Well... wrong is a big word. It's just a matter of personal
  preference I think. But let me give you a list of reasons why I
  prefer cruxports.
</p>

<ul>
  <li>Lightweight.
  <li>Always the latest versions of software, no matter which
  release you use.
  <li>CRUX ports are much easier to create and maintain since the
  ports are shell-based.
  <li>Portable, anyone can read and understand a cruxport.
  <li>Dependencies are optional.
  <li>It's not trying to be braindead-proof.
  <li>No checking of md5sum on uninstall of files.
  <li>Files in /etc <i>are</i> installed, and maintained with a
    mergemaster like application (rejmerge) in a sane and easy
    way.
  <li>You can easily share your own ports with others with httpup.
  <li>Does not conflict with other package-managers.
  <li>You can build packages from alternative sources like binaries or CVS.
  <li>You can install packages on systems with very little resources.
</ul>

<p>
  So take a look around at the files in this directory and see
  for yourself if cruxports is something for you.
