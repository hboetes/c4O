Most stuff for cruxports is documented on crux.nu but there are
some specific differences which you have to take in account if you
want to port a cruxport to OpenBSD.

The Linux-version of cruxports use arrays; variables that are
defined like this:

     var=(foo bar)

On OpenBSD you'll have to use:

    var="foo bar"


The prefix on Linux is /usr, on OpenBSD /usr/local is used.


There are often OpenBSD specific patches which can be found in the
/usr/ports ports-tree. I usually use them as well, like this:

    cd /usr/cruxports/somedir/someport
    cat /usr/ports/*/someport/patch/patch-* > someport.patch

I always check the patch though. It may contain ports specific
changes.

And then in the Pkgfile I add: ``someport.patch'' to the
``source-variable'' and ``patch -p0 < $SRC/someport.patch'' to the
build instructions.


Cruxports on OpenBSD has two extra functions which you can use in the build-function:

   sed-i, which imitates the sed -i function supported by gnu-sed.

   remove_perl_crap, which removes useless files from perl-ports.
